# Image-Stitching-Panorama
From a set of images with overlapping content, we use Harris features to attach them all together into a single Panoramic Image


Just take the "Image_Stiching_Panorama.m" code and use "Forsyth_Graffiti" set of images if you are testing the code. It would work independently. 

Note: If you use other set of codes you might have to change a few things, caliberate the camera first, which wouldn't work since, those pics are not taken from your phone. And then make use of of "Mosaicing.m" code to do it more accurately.

For doubts text me on tejas.krishnareddy1415@gmail.com.
